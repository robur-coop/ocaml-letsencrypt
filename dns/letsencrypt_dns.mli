(** [dns_solver (fun domain content)] is a solver for dns-01 challenges.

    name servers serve a TXT record at [domain] with the content. The
    [domain] already has the [_acme-challenge.] prepended. *)

    before continuing with ACME. *)
val print_dns : Letsencrypt.Client.solver

(** [nsupdate ~proto id now send ~recv ~keyname key ~zone]
    constructs a dns solver that sends a DNS update packet (using [send])
    and optionally waits for a signed reply (using [recv] if present) to solve
    challenges. The update is signed with a hmac transaction signature
    (DNS TSIG) using [now ()] as timestamp, and the [keyname] and [key] for
    the cryptographic material. The [zone] is the one to be used in the
    query section of the update packet. If signing, sending, or receiving
    fails, the error is reported. *)
